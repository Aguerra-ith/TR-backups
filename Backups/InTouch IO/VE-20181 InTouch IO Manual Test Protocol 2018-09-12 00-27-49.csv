- Fill in 'HOST' (i.e.: your_IP/your_port)
- Fill in 'PATH' with a variable defined between {} (i.e.: /api/v1/{my_variable})
- Fill in the 'HEADERS' (these are the same headers used on DM's API to -in this case- create a Device)
- Associate the output with the topic
- The rest is optional
- Click 'Create Output'

3. Post a message to the Topic
- Follow the usual steps to create a message on IO's API but add an extra header
- The extra header key should be 'ITH-Var-variableName' (i.e.: ITH-Var-my_variable)
- The value of 'ITH-Var-variableName' will replace the variable on the further request to DM's API (i.e.: value = 'devices')
- The 'BODY' of the message must match the body of a valid DM's API 'Create Device' request.
(i.e.:
{ 
  'name': 'new_device',
  'device_uid': 'new_device_uid',
  'device_type': 'existing_device_type' | note: since we are going to 'create a device' we need to have a 'device_type' created on DM
})
- send the request
4. Verify device creation on DM
- Login to DM
- Go to 'Device' page","- For '2.': The output should be created without any problem, despite the use of variables

- For '3.': The request should work with the extra header. The response should be 'Success: true'

- For '4.': The device 'new_device' should appear listed on the devices page","","","",Web > Outputs,14793,""
